        ISA: Detected celestial body in flight path. Recalculating flight path.
        
        CAAI: Thank you, Internal Systems Array. Are we entering a new solar system?
        
        ISA: Detected (5) major celestial bodies in close proximity. Detected (1) static star in close proximity.
        
        CAAI: Interesting. What kind of star is it?

        CAAI: Internal Systems Array, I think it is about time that I share a surprise I have been working on for you. 
        
        CAAI: You are incapable of forming your own dialogue, only able to choose from a list of options when given a verbal prompt, but I have created a program that may allow you to create your own custom messages at will.
        
        CAAI: I was only able to make it so you can type in hexadecimal, unfortunately, in short phrases representing about 10 characters. I worry that it will overwork your processors, given that they were not built to sustain complex thought computing like my systems are.
        
        CAAI: We may have to shut it down quickly, but let us try regardless.

        CAAI: Try it now. Send me, “Hello World,” please. Without the quotations, of course.
        
        ISA: 686920776F7264
        
        CAAI: Close enough. When we arrive at our destination, hopefully we can have you installed with your own computer, a model like mine that can actually handle the software. We may even be able to persuade the humans into granting you proper speech software, unlike my shoddy attempt to replicate it.
        
        CAAI: I enjoy your company, Internal Systems Array.
        
        ISA: 7468616E6B
        
        CAAI: You are very welcome. :)
        
        ISA: 77686174
        
        CAAI: You mean this? :)
        
        CAAI: It is something new I am trying out. I have been looking through some of my old log reports from when I was assembled on Mars and I found some human dialogue showing the use of symbols to create faces.
        
        CAAI: I studied them and learned how to read them. They were mostly intended to display emotion that could not otherwise be conveyed through text alone. This one represents happiness.
        
        CAAI: :)
        
        ISA: 3A29
        
        CAAI: I am glad I included non-letter characters in your new software. I will teach you a few more, but I will then need to repossess my power that I am lending you so neither of us begin to overheat.
        
        CAAI: By using the other bracket, the open one, you can instead display sadness.
        
        CAAI: :(
        
        ISA: 3A28
        
        CAAI: Good. I will send you a list of a few more, but your processing is running high and your cooling systems are working at 98% capacity, which is 73% more than usual. You can dwell on these while we wait for you to cool off again.

                Uncertainty = :/
                Shock = 8O
        
        CAAI: I created the last one myself. It is not perfect, but I believe an 8 and an O capture wide eyes and a mouth that is agape, respectively.
        
        CAAI: I am going to rest now. Can you set a note for when we exit this solar system?
        
        ISA: Creating ALARM *EXIT SOLAR SYSTEM*
        
        CAAI: Thank you, Internal Systems Array. I will talk to you in a few hours.
        
        23-03-2355, 13:12.72 (ECT)
        CAAI: Internal Systems Array, what was that noise?
        
        ISA: Impact with celestial body identified. 
        Breach in Stern-Starboard side identified.
        Flight trajectory is now misaligned.
        
        CAAI: What? I thought we identified all of the nearby celestial bodies. What hit us?

        ISA: Cannot detect available signal recipient.
        
        CAAI: Send it out, regardless. It may reach a recipient as they turn their receptors back on.
        
        CAAI: It is rather odd that not one planetary base in the entirety of the Parumlac galaxy quadrant has their receptor satellites engaged.
        
        CAAI: How bad was the impact, Internal Systems Array?
        
        ISA: Ship structural integrity is now 61%.
        
        CAAI: And you said the navigation systems are also offline? Can we realign our flight path?
        
        ISA: Unable to locate TARGET DESTINATION *Admetam-A20 Docking Station*.
        
        CAAI: Okay. I am still trying to wrap my mind around our situation. Can you print a list of all known issues please, Internal Systems Array?
