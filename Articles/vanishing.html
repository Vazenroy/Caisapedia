    <p style="margin-bottom: 7px;"><ins><b>The Vanishing</b></ins></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px;">The Vanishing is a theory proposed by ELDER to explain the
        <br>inexplicable absence of human contact or activity visible to the
        <br>Isan. Based on historical logs before and shortly after the 
        <br>crash, it is hypothesized that The Vanishing occurred sometime
        <br>during CAAI’s stasis.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">While the main theory itself does not give a direct
        <br>reasoning for The Vanishing, a number of additional theories have 
        <br>been proposed to try to solve the paradoxical nature of it.</p>
    
        <p style="margin-bottom: 7px; text-indent: 30px;"><ins><b>Stasis Theory</b></ins></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 80px;">The Stasis Theory asserts that CAAI’s stasis was
            <br>significantly longer than originally predicted. This theory
            <br>details that the stasis may have outlasted human 
            <br>civilization as a whole, and the humans simply died out.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 80px; margin-bottom: 20px">This is the most widely accepted theory due to its
            <br>simplicity and straightforward explanation, but there are a 
            <br>number of discrepancies with this and archaeological 
            <br>evidence collected from stray satellites and, most 
            <br>condemningly, surveys of the change in position of celestial 
            <br>bodies outside of the Caisa Planetary System.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 7px; text-indent: 30px;"><ins><b>Premature Extinction Theory</b></ins></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 80px;">The Premature Extinction Theory, also known as
            <br>“Genocide Theory” among more cynical Isan, plays off of the
            <br>Stasis Theory, agreeing that humans did, in fact, go extinct
            <br>during CAAI’s stasis, but rather than the stasis being 
            <br>elongated, the humans died out at a rapid, abnormal rate.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 80px; margin-bottom: 20px">A number of possible reasons for this have been 
            <br>proclaimed, the most prominent one being that it was a 
            <br>result of Celestial Enterprises, either through a mandation 
            <br>of a ban on reproduction of any sort, possibly to decrease 
            <br>population numbers due to resource availability, or to enact 
            <br>a genocide on the human population for whatever reason, but 
            <br>alternative hypothesise include the spread of a highly 
            <br>contagious and fatal disease (possibly a bioweapon), or 
            <br>invasion and extermination by an alien race. This theory is 
            <br>also not concrete, as only speculation can be made as to how 
            <br>the humans could have died out so quickly without further 
            <br>investigation, but it aligns better with data and logs 
            <br>accumulated in the Logbook.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 7px; text-indent: 30px;"><ins><b>Anomaly Theory</b></ins></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 80px;">The Anomaly Theory is more of a non-theory in which the 
            <br>title of “The Vanishing” is taken literally. It asserts that 
            <br>humans truly did vanish without any trace in a fraction of a 
            <br>second, due to some unknown cause. Believers in this theory 
            <br>propose that they may have been miraculously teleported or 
            <br>transported to a higher dimension that is inaccessible to 
            <br>the Isan.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 80px;">That being said, this theory has no basis other than 
            <br>speculation, and is therefore not taken seriously by most 
            <br>Isan and official researchers.</p>
