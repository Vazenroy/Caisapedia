    <p style="margin-bottom: 7px;"><ins><b>The Star</b></ins></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px;"><b>The Star</b> is the central star of the <b>Caisa Planetary System.</b>
        <br>Upon the arrival of <b>CAAI</b> in the year 2355 AD, the Star was
        <br>believed to be a white dwarf, a remnant of a dead star that
        <br>existed eons before <b>humans</b> were even recorded to have existed.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px;">However, after centuries of <b>Isan</b> development and expansion
        <br>across the Caisa Planetary System, the Star has been observed to
        <br>grow in size and shift in hue. According to the <b>human records</b> and
        <br>observations done by experienced <b>Astronomeers</b>, the growth of the
        <br>Star is at an abnormally high rate when compared to other stars
        <br>within the <b>Parumlac (Lechita) Quadrant</b> of the <b>Milky Way Galaxy.</b></p>
	<p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px;">It is hypothesized that the Star may be a unique type of
        <br>star referred to as a quark star. Little is known about these
        <br>previously only theoretical celestial bodies, other than that
        <br>they are so dense that the pressure within breaks down subatomic
        <br>particles and allows their quarks to roam free, creating a makeup
        <br>of which is called quark matter.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px; line-height: 20px;">The rapid expansion of the Star, however, is only abnormal
        <br>when compared to the lifecycle of other observed stars and is no
        <br>cause for alarm. It is unknown whether quark stars are capable of
        <br>becoming super-massive stars or even going supernova, but when
        <br>projecting the typical lifecycle of a star onto the Star at its
        <br>current rate of growth, a supernova event is still calculated to
        <br>not occur until at least 980 million years from now.</p>
